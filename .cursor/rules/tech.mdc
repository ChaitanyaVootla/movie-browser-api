Main technologies
- Nodejs with express
- strong typing with typescript
- AWS lambda for scraping

We use the following libraries
- knex to communicate with postgresql
- zod for type validation
- serverless to deploy lambda and api gateway to AWS
- pino for logging (always use pino logger from [logger.ts](mdc:src/utils/logger.ts), do not user console.log)
