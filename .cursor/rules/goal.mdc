# Goal of movie-browser-api

The goal of this open source API project is to enrich the TMDB API with additional data related to ratings, reviews, and watch links for movies and TV series. We will leverage external data to build a modular, scalable, and cost-effective service.

Key Endpoints
GET /api/v1/movie/{id}

GET /api/v1/tv/{id}

GET /api/v1/movie/multiple?ids={ids}

GET /api/v1/tv/multiple?ids={ids}

Additional Considerations
Regional Customization: Leverage Google search's gl parameter to retrieve region-specific watch link data for 20â€“30 major countries.

Update Mechanism: Rely on the TMDB changes API to trigger updates; recent releases will be refreshed daily while older titles can have a reduced update frequency.

Cost Effectiveness:

Use AWS Lambda for on-demand scraping to minimize server costs.

Use Cloudflare for free/unmetered CDN delivery.

Run PostgreSQL on a cost-effective EC2 instance.

This updated plan outlines a scalable, modular approach to enriching TMDB data with external ratings, reviews, and watch links while maintaining cost efficiency and high performance.
